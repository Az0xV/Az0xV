## Hi there 👋

Hello, I'm **Peter** and I'm 18 years old.

I would like to show my project, so you can get to know me better.

## [Platformer](https://github.com/Az0xV/Platformer) <<
This is simple game where you are a cube, and you need to destroy other bad cubes.

There's no story in story mode, but there's boss at the end of it.

## [Messages](https://github.com/Az0xV/Python?tab=readme-ov-file#messages) <<
A client-server application that allows you to send messages across a local network, 

using network sockets with multiple connections to one server.

If you would to analyze my code, you can learn the basics of network communication and synchronization.

## [Leap Year](https://github.com/Az0xV/Leap-Year) <<
A challenging game, where you need to go from point A to point B.

There's no time pressure or anything, that's why this game is calm, and one of my favorites.

## How to download a game?
In every unity game repository there is a download link at the end.

If you click on the link, you download a zip file containing the game.

Here's what to do with this file in 3 steps:
1.  Extract the zip file, by clicking right mouse button on this .zip file in file explorer. Then a menu will show up, find and click "Extract All..."
2.  A folder will show up, so open the folder.
3.  Find .exe file inside, and open it. The game should start now, however it can be blocked by antivirus, and it's normal with uncertified applications. Stay safe!
