## Hi there 👋

Hello, I'm **Peter** and I'm 18 years old.

I would like to show my project, so you can get to know me better.

## [Platformer](https://github.com/Az0xV/Platformer) <<
This is simple game where you are a cube, and you need to destroy other bad cubes.

There's no story in story mode, but there's boss at the end of it.

## [Messages](https://github.com/Az0xV/Python?tab=readme-ov-file#messages) <<
A client-server application that allows you to send messages across a local network, 

using network sockets with multiple connections to one server.

If you would to analyze my code, you can learn the basics of network communication and synchronization.

## [Leap Year](https://github.com/Az0xV/Leap-Year) <<
A challenging game, where you need to go from point A to point B.

There's no time pressure or anything, that's why this game is calm, and one of my favorites.
