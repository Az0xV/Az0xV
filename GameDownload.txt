## How to download a game?
In every unity game repository there is a download link at the end.

If you click on the link, you download a zip file containing the game.

Here's what to do with this file in 3 steps:
1.  Extract the zip file, by clicking right mouse button on this .zip file in file explorer. Then a menu will show up, find and click "Extract All..."
2.  A folder will show up, so open the folder.
3.  Find .exe file inside, and open it. The game should start now, however it can be blocked by antivirus, and it's normal with uncertified applications. Stay safe!
